Original [here](https://github.com/rob-mccann/Pi-Voice), rewritten so that everything is in Python. The following python packages are
needed:

- audiotools
- pyaudio
- requests

These may be installed using pip, on OSX I had to follow
[this](http://invibe.net/LaurentPerrinet/SciBlog/2012-04-22) guide to install
audiotools.

Python's tempfile module is used for the temporary files.
